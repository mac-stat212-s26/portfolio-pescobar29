At the Micro-enterprise level, legal structures are relatively homogeneous, consisting primarily of sole proprietorships and simple innovation models.\nAs we progress to Small-enterprises, there is a significant shift toward the Limited Liability Business Company (LLC). This suggests that as a firm outgrows the ‘Micro’ stage, it typically adopts this more flexible structure to benefit from corporate liability protection.\nHowever, the most complex diversification occurs in the ‘Other’ category (supposedly representing the largest firms). While the LLC structure remains prevalent, this group introduces much more sophisticated ownership models, such as Privately Held Corporations and Publicly Traded Corporations. This evidence suggests a direct correlation between scale and complexity: in the beginning, very small firms tend to rely on simpler ownership structures, then, when the companies expand, almost all of them are identify as LLC. However, as the companies expand even more in capital and size, they inevitably transition into more robust legal frameworks to manage greater regulatory requirements and investment needs, as seen in the plot.",
